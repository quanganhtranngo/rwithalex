# Hi, my name is Quang-Anh Ngo Tran (Alex Tran)!

I am a first-year graduate student in the Social Psychology department at Indiana University Bloomington from Vietnam, advised by Dr. Amanda Diekman. I am particularly interested in the psychology of the -isms, bias, prejudice, and interminority coalition. My prior work has focused on the intersectionality of race and gender in social cognition.

My blog is a mix of my own creative pieces, poetry, and drawings/doodles.
