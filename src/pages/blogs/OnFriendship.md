&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I met Josh was during Orientation Week for International Students at Colgate University, a small elite privileged liberal arts institution in upstate New York. The breezes of fall swept my attention away at every minute, but Josh kept my attention back on the ground. I was a magnet and so was he. Everyone was circling around him, so I chose to avoid him. In the stuffed cubical room, we were polar opposites. Like a dance, I slid to the other side of the room whenever he was on one side. Our conversations were demarcated by the English textbook introduction conversations: “Hey, what’s your name? My name is […]. Hi. Nice to meet you.” Nothing more, nothing less, nothing short of the superficial friendliness that would irk me more now than then. He was a strong magnet, though, since soon after, everyone printed their name tag as “Josh Kim.” I was intrigued. Suddenly, the room didn’t feel so stuffed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenny was different. He was me and more. We had our first “deep talk” in our dining hall, over our shared dream of helping others through Psychology, the banalest conversation two undergrads could have entertained that meant the world to me. We both liked to dance, were both K-pop fanatics, and both majored/minored in Psychology and Education, a list of similarities sounding as if I had to find a reason why we became best friends or else my brain would explode. But he was so much more. He loved basketball, a sport that I could not entertain one conversation that is as in-depth as my love for him. He prized his green jersey from some team I cannot bring my mind to remember (it was Celtics) as I prized my 13 Blackpink poster shrine on my wall.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hsu wrote, “there are many currencies to friendship. […] Some friends complete us, while others complicate us.” I don’t even know where Josh would stand – he is both, and neither. I can hardly say debating for over 2 hours over whether humans control language and have free-will completes me or complicates me. The only thing more heated than that conversation, which meant everything and nothing at the same time, was the pot of rice he couldn’t master for the life of his. I can say I love him more than his rice, which is ironic how the currency of Asian culinary is mastering cooking rice. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to say to hundreds of people in a speech that Josh is this scary person who made me cry multiple times, not the bully type, but the type that forced me to face my authentic self and held me to my standards. I oversimplified it. Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor coined the term authenticity for the essence of a human, which some have argued that is constantly in flux while others argued its innateness. But I was wrong to assume authenticity operates within me only. Taylor believes, to which now I understand, that authenticity morphs in dialogue with people with whom we interact.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenny had the heart of gold, and I admired and envied him for it. I, on the other hand, was much more cynical and less believing in human’s innate kindness. I am the one who would admire the villain and not-so-secretly advocate for her success, just to prove that goodness will not prevail in our society. One time, Kenny shared with me his resume, in which I learned he won the Be Kind Award. “Of course he did,” I thought snarkily. He was kind enough to save me from my miseries, patching my deeply learned insecurities without even touching them. I remembered how his eyes lit up helping others and me, sometimes at the expense of his own well-being, while the institution judges him for slacking off academically. He was in fact one of the smartest men I know whose heart was bigger than his head. In a society where logic and sensibility are defined by outcomes, albeit it be money, grades, or assignments turned in on time, he had no place in it. In a world of love and kindness, he would be king. But I would be fooling myself to believe his life is a cool breeze accentuated by golden sunset hues. I wanted to protect him, to love him the way he loved others. I wanted to understand how he believed in human’s kindest selves in the grand scheme of this tempestuous world. This world is no roses. I envied him. Around Kenny, I believe in humans. Is that my authentic self? Or is it the looking glass self I see through Kenny? He must be a magician, conjuring authenticity out of nothingness, or worse yet, its opposites. Then I must be inauthentic around Josh. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh shares my cynicism in ways that transcend the edgy teen prototype. He remains hopeful but realistic of the power dynamics running in the veins of societal institutions. He is smart. But, unlike me, he embraces conflict. Philosopher Jacques Derrida calls for the disruption of dichotomies and acceptance of contradictions – the private life and the public life, the friend and the enemy – similar to the concept of Yin and Yang, which Kenny idolizes and exemplifies in his perfect balance. I, on the other hand, prize control, the predictability and simplicity of an organization that I hold. Around Josh, I am more cynical and less believing of humankind. Then I must be inauthentic around Kenny. Either authenticity is a shapeshifter or I am. I champion the former. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a child, my definition of friendship was rife with authenticity and the idea of being known. Perhaps, now, friendship is about authenticity (the shapeshifter kind) and knowing others. Derrida states that a friend would “choose knowing rather than being known.” In writing, I choose knowing, knowing that I know nothing - what makes us best friends, what sustains a friendship, who Josh and Kenny are, who I am, when we will separate. The present is a drag while the future bears all the ill-wills of uncertainty.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fear of separation, I questioned my friendship with Josh. “Were our memories not enough?,” he screamed as tears streamed down his clear Korean cheeks. I had never seen him cry before. Just two months ago, we shared a love shot, two peach soju cups interlocked in two arms, a ritual that was supposed to mean something. We talked about the future as I looked out his window into the starry night. I dared not look at him, one eye staring at the fear of the separation, the other eye at the beautiful stars that will be snuffed out when tomorrow comes. What is fear, if not love turned inside out? The room was stuffed with the rubber smell of the 3 balloons hung on his wall. No scent of soju left to be savored. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still don’t know what friendship means but I now know that I need to know. Only then can I be known.
