[Drawing by me]

One petal  
You were so young  
And so was I.  
We locked arms  
Exchanging a love shot  
Sealing our fates.  
Sleepless nights   
He loves me.  

Two petals  
Our fates ever so twisted  
For it was not arms that were locked  
But the spiral of confidence and egos  
That brought us both down.  
In a capitalistic business  
Cloaked as academic institution,  
You became a pawn,  
I, a hero.  
A promise of protection  
Broken.  
He loves me not.  

Three petals  
How to feel when I am the problem  
How to feel when my presence brings  
So haunting and daunting  
A legacy  
How to feel when to love  
Is to let you go.  
What is fear,  
If not love turned inside out.  
What is gratitude,  
If guilt doesn’t lurk in the shadows.  
The flower wilts.  
 
Four petals  
I swipe right since everything went left  
I swipe left since nothing was right  
Endless motions of meaninglessness  
Empty  
When the petals fall,  
All that’s left is the gravity of the stem  
Holding it all together  
But nothing left to hold.  
I love you still,  
But the flower is dead.
